# MEDIATION catalog Website Sources

![github pages](https://github.com/sasip-climate/sasip-climate.github.io/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

This repository contains all sources for the MEDIATION catalog webpage.
The site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.
The source files are written in markdown.
A [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/sasip-climate/sasip-climate.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml) will soon be configured to automatically build and deploy the website to <https://sasip-climate.github.io/> whenever the `main` branch of this repo is updated.

You can visit the resulting website here : https://mediation-ocean.github.io
